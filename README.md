# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC

In this project, we create a ML pipeline used to predict the price given input real estate data that's continuously fed into the pipeline, allowing for retraining and new predictions to be made.
The pipeline/model is an appraisal-like system in which typical prices for a given property are estimated based on the price of similar properties.

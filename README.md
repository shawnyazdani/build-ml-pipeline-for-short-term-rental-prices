# Build an ML Pipeline for Short-Term Rental Prices in NYC
You are working for a property management company renting rooms and properties for short periods of 
time on various rental platforms. You need to estimate the typical price for a given property based 
on the price of similar properties. Your company receives new data in bulk every week. The model needs 
to be retrained with the same cadence, necessitating an end-to-end pipeline that can be reused.

In this project, we create a ML pipeline used to predict the price given input real estate data that's continuously fed into the pipeline, allowing for retraining and new predictions to be made.
